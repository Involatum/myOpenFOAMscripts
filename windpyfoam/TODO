 Using pyFoamPlotWatcher.py as a base, present plots during runtime

Control of processor number
 make sure exactly nprocs are used:
  during runCases, use nproc queues, instead of running all cases in paralle.

QueueProc:
 while cases.pop() as case:
  runCase(case)

def runCases(cases, nproc)
    # cases is a thread safe queue (multiprocessing.queue)
    for i in xrange(nprocs):
        startThread(QueueProc, cases)
